###What is jQuery?
- ReferenceError: Can't find Variable: $100 (or you may have forgot to put quotes around '$100')
```
$("span").text($100) // 如果不加引号就是变量哇！！！明确变量和字符串的区别。
```

- Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded.推荐语法：
```
$( document ).ready(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});
```

###Using jQuery
- Now that we have jQuery loaded, we need a place to put all the JavaScript code that we will be working on. Let's load our custom `application.js` file. Make sure it's after `jquery.min.js`, since we want to use that in our `application.js` file.

> `application.js`是自定义的js库，需要放在`jquery.min.js`之后。

- 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Home</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="homepage-wrapper">
      <h2>Welcome to jQuery Travels - Traversing the DOM since 2006</h2>
      <p>Fly to New York today for as little as <span>$299.99</span></p>
    </div>
    <script src="jquery.min.js"></script> // 为什么放在 /body 之前？
    <script src="application.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- We need to select some of the vacation list items below, but not all of them. Let's start by only selecting the vacations list. Use an ID selector to only select the list with an ID of `#vacations`.

> 因为在一个 document 中 id 只有一个，所以用 id 选择器时直接学 `#idName`，如

- 
```
$('#vacations'); // 注意前面的井号以及语句之后的分号
```

- You did a great job selecting the correct list, and now we only want to select vacations that are available for America. Use a class selector to only select the vacations with a class of .america. Keep in mind that `<li class="vacation america">` means that there are two classes for that element: `.vacation` and `.america.`

> 一个元素有多个class，没关系，选自己所需就好

- 
```
$('.america')
```
